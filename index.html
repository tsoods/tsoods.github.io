<h2>Global monthly semiconductor sales drop as chip market takes another hit</h2>
<p>Worldwide semiconductor sales are down 0.5% in September, on a month-to-month basis, <br>
    according to statistics released by the Semiconductor Industry Association, and down 3% compared to September 2021, <br>
    as demand continues to soften in the face of multiple macroeconomic difficulties.

According to the SIAâ€™s report, September chip buying in the Americas region rose by 11.5% compared to the same month in 2021, <br>
    to a total of just over $12 billion, and upticks to $4.53 billion and $4.05 billion,<br>
    respectively were seen in Europe and Japan. Those gains, however, were more than offset by the mainland Chinese market falling by 14.4% to $14.43 billion in the same time frame,<br>
    along with a 7.7% decline to $11.97 billion in all other markets.

    The decline is the first year-on-year slowdown since January 2020, according to a statement issued by SIA president and CEO John Neuffer.</p>
