<p>"Nobody think support is fun because y'all suck at DPS

You can't deny it. Everyone wants to play DPS, but 75% are absolutely garbage at it.

Y'all don't switch characters when you're not hitting shots or being countered. If you're Ashe getting amped up by Mercy and miss EVERY SINGLE SHOT in your clip, you need to switch.<br>

Barely any of you counter the opposing teams characters. If theres a phara, symmetra and reaper are probably the worst combo to pick to fight against her. Fucking pick soldier and shoot that flying turd out of the sky. I don't give a fuck if you have 47% of your fucking ult, SWITCH.<br>

I get it, you all love to play genji, but you're all trash at him. No, you can't get healed when you're in their back line behind 17 walls. No, most of you can't get more than 1 kill with blade because you pop it right in front of their entire team while they're all fucking shooting at you, you fucking idiot. No, you can't 1v5 them, you're made of fucking glass. Why do you think you need healing so god damn much? There's no chance you can take on AN ENTIRE FUCKING TEAM by yourself. You can't even handle a 1v2. Fucking chill, or better yet, switch.

If theres a god damn fat ass road hog, fucking hit that mother fucker with reaper and eat that bitch for lunch. Jesus fucking christ. After you reap your way through him, fuckin zen and ana in the back line are a tasty snack too, fuck.<br>

Is there a rein in front of you holding up his glorious blue shield? You know who fucking LOVES to eat shields? Sym. That bitch fucking omnomnomnomnomnoms shields. I don't care if your waifu is tracer, she can't fucking break a shield. Switch you dumb bitch

And don't get me started on Zarya. I swear yall dumbasses think shooting her bubbles makes her die faster. Some people say she's OP, but I think yall are just stupid.<br>

Healers can't heal you if they're dead. If they're dead, its probably because you all don't do enough damage or help them.

Learn positioning. Keep LOS with your healers. Protect your healers.<br>

and for fucks sake, GROUP UP. This is probably the easiest part of the game. You just fucking sit at spawn and wait for your ENTIRE TEAM to get together, then you all go the same way to the same place and shoot the same people at the same time. I really don't know why this is such a hard concept to grasp."
